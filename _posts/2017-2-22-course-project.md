## Compiler Principle

- Time: Jan 2017
- Language: c++/yacc/lex
- Link: <https://github.com/Elitack/Compiler>
- Function:
  1. Implement a lexical analyzer that separates the smallc language into tokens.
  2. Do the syntax analysis.
  3. Complete the semantic analyzer and immediate code generation with the formation of parsing tree.

## Computer Architecture

- Time: Jan 2017
- Language: c
- Link: <https://github.com/Elitack/CSArchitecture>
- Function:
  1. Write and simulate Y86 programs.
  2. Add a new instruction.
  3. Improve the performance of the pipelined y86 processor.

## Programming Language

- Times: Dec 2016
- Language: java

## Operating System

- Time: June 2016
- Language: c
- Function:
  1. Write a new system call(ptree) in Linux.
  2. Generate a new process and output its parent pid and child pid.
  3. Use the pthread and lock to solve the classic burger buddies problem.
  4. Change the scheduler of the process.
  5. Modify the scheduler in kernel.
